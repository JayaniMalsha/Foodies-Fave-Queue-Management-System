# Foodies-Fave-Queue-Management-System
Java/ JavaFX
The Foodies Fave Queue Management System aims to create a system for a Foodies Fave Food center with three cashiers and each queue having a maximum of 2,3,5 customers. The system will have 50 burgers in stock, and each customer added to the queue will be updated with their name. A warning message will be displayed when the stock reaches 10 burgers. Operators can perform tasks using a console menu, such as viewing all queues, viewing empty queues, adding customers, removing customers, sorting customers alphabetically, storing program data, loading data from a file, viewing remaining burger stock, adding burgers to stock, and exiting the program.

A second version of the Foodies Fave queue management system is created using an array of FoodQueue Objects, which can manage 3 queues parallelly. This version includes a class called FoodQueue and another class called Customer, which function as in Task 1. Each queue can hold up to 2,3,5 customers, with additional information such as First Name, Second Name, and number of burgers required. The income of each queue can be printed, and the system should function as in Task 1.

Add to a waiting queue is also added to the Queue class version. Modify the '102 or ACQ Add customer to a Queue' and '104 or PCQ: Remove a served customer' options to include a waiting list queue if the food queues are full. When removing a served customer, the next customer in the waiting list queue is automatically placed in the food queue.

Lastly, a JavaFX GUI is created for the operator to view the status of the queues, view customer details, and search customer details. The GUI should be called through Command Prompt.

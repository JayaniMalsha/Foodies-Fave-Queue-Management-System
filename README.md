# Foodies-Fave-Queue-Management-System
Java/ JavaFX
The food center uses a program to manage queues with 50 burgers in stock,
allowing operators to perform tasks like viewing, adding, removing, and
sorting customers. A second version manages three queues parallelly, adding
a waiting list and modifying options. A JavaFX GUI is created for operators.
